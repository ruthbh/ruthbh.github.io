  "body": "# The 5 things I'd Love to Do\r\n1. Own technical context about how Zapier works\r\n2. Talk to Users\r\n3. Use Sketch/Photoshop/etc. to design user flows and wireframes.. Ok.. Here I have to say... I've only used Axure for prototyping. \r\n4. Learn a new skill to fill in a gap on your team. _Always willing to learn (a.e. how to use GitHub...)_\r\n5. Manage the team's tasks on a weekly basis\r\n\r\n## BONUS!\r\nI really enjoy UML modeling (use cases and sequence diagrams) \r\n\r\n# The 5 things I'd not like that much\r\n1. Decide core KPIs for projects at Zapier\r\n2. Interview and decide from a list of Product Managers to hire. \r\n3. Commit HTML or JS code directly to our main repo.\r\n4. Ship good looking CSS directly to our main repo\r\n5. [Not Listed] Project Financial Management. ",
